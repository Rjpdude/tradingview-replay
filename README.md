# tradingview-replay
Execute trades on tradingview replay mode through selenium (personal project). The ultimate app to train.

**NOTE** This is a [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) app. If you're looking to run this app, you'll need to familiarize yourself with how to run a node app. It shouldn't be too difficult if you're atleast somewhat technical.
